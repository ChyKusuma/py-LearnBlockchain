# Blockchain Software

## Purpose
This blockchain software was created for educational purposes, here you can learn how to build blockchain layer 1 software from scratch.

## File Usage
1. **Block Creation**: The `block.py` file is responsible for creating blocks in the blockchain.
2. **Blockchain**: The `blockchain.py` file contains the implementation of the blockchain itself.
3. **Wallet**: The `wallet.py` file handles wallet functionalities such as private and public key creation.
4. **Private and Public Key Creation**: Handled within the `wallet.py` file.
5. **Account**: The concept of accounts is integrated within the blockchain and wallet functionalities.
6. **Database**: No separate database file is used; however, the blockchain data is stored in memory.
7. **Transaction**: Transactions are managed within the `transaction.py` file.
8. **Merkle Trees**: Merkle tree implementation is present in the `trees.py` file.
9. **Proof-of-Work**: The proof-of-work algorithm is implemented within the mining process of the blockchain.

## Running the Program
To test and run the program, simply execute the following command in the terminal:

- git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/blockchain-repo.git
- cd blockchain-repo
- `python3 main.py`

## Installation Guide for Python3
If Python3 is not installed on your system, follow these steps to install it:

1. **Linux/Ubuntu**:
   - Open the terminal.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python3
     ```

2. **MacOS**:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) and download the latest Python 3 installer.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.

3. **Windows**:
   - Open a web browser.
   - Go to the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest Python 3 installer.
   - Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH".
   - Follow the instructions to complete the installation.


This README provides information about the purpose of the blockchain software, its file usage, how to run the program, and a guide for installing Python3.
