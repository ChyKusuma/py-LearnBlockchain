- **how to created key pair and wallet address**
- **how to created the block**
- **how to chaining the validated block**
- **how to mining using proof-of-work**
- **how to mined genesis block**
- **how to compute merkle trees**
- **how to save into database**


## Running the Program
To test and run the program, simply execute the following command in the terminal:

- git clone https://github.com/ChyKusuma/py-LearnBlockchain.git blockchain-repo
- cd blockchain-repo
- command on your terminal `python3 src/main.py`

## My tests result (Updated)
